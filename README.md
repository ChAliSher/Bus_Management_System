You should open the Java files on the software IntelliJ IDEA.
I have uploaded the Java zip that includes Java front-end files.
There is the database code as well that can be run on MYSQL Workbench.
Moreover, I have added the java connectors for the IntelliJ IDEA software that will help you connect the Java front-end with MYSQL database.
To understand, how to connect the java connector with SQL, I recommend you to watch a YouTube tutorial and then go for it.
